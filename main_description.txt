### `main.py` (The "Coordinator")

This is the main script that you run from the command line. It acts as the conductor, coordinating the other two modules to run the game.

*   **Initialization:** It creates an instance of the `GameClient` to connect to the server and an instance of the `WordleSolver` to handle the logic.
*   **Game Loop:** It contains the main `while` loop that runs for each attempt (up to 6 times).
*   **Orchestration:** Inside the loop, it:
    1.  Asks the `WordleSolver` to choose a word.
    2.  Tells the `GameClient` to submit that word to the server.
    3.  Gets the feedback from the `GameClient`.
    4.  Gives that feedback to the `WordleSolver` so it can filter its word list.
*   **User Interface:** It handles all the `print` statements that show the game's progress, the bot's guesses, and the final result.

This structure separates the code into logical, independent parts, making it much cleaner and easier to understand and improve in the future.
